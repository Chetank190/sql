**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


While designing database schema, we should include practice of etichs and inequality component as changing database structure later can be a mundane task. Though if discreprencies found later should be addressed immediately. Include a user_roles table that categorizes users based on their access levels (e.g., admin, healthcare provider, community advocate). This ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to those who need it for their role, enhancing data privacy and ethical use. Include a consent_forms table to track patient consent for data usage, specifying what data can be used and for which purposes. This promotes transparency and respect for patient autonomy.

Implement a feedback table to collect patient experiences and suggestions. Analyzing this data can help identify areas for improvement in service delivery and address inequities in care. This step should be taken seriously and a team should be looking into these concerns if any. Add a training sessions table that tracks employee training on ethical data use, cultural competency, and health equity. This can foster a culture of awareness and accountability within the organization. Any new employees who joined should complete these trainings and if done correctly database should be updated.
